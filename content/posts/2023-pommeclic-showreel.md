## Context

Those last months, we experienced a slow-down phase regarding works volume with [Pommeclic](https://www.pommeclic.com).

This gave us the time to think about updating our legacy homepage, untouched since 2020.

At first, I started to brainstorm, then wireframed some sections using Figma.

Quickly thought, the idea on releasing a showreel made its way, as our videos production got noticeable bigger over time.

This is what I call thinking showreel first ðŸ˜¼.

## Process

### 1. Web design

After having setting up a pretty elegant homepage layout, I coded the design with Next.js + Framer Motion for the animations.

### 2. Work selection

Then, we listed various works released during the last 18 months, trying to get a wide range of type.

### 3. Storyboard

A showreel is built using existing pieces of works, so the process is different than designing a whole concept from scratch.

The focus here is dealing with rythm, transitions and some showcase principles.

The only whole creative part here was the intro.

I storyboarded it using the desktop [Storyboarder app](https://storyboarder.com/) and designed the first work placeholder using some usual pages placeholder.

### 4. Music first

I quickly realized it would be much more interesting to use the background music as a whole animation driver instead of just adding it on top at the end.

We decided ourself for an original chill/hip-hop piece, with a high emphase on timed beats.

This sound driver helped me define several key principles I would be using across the reel:

- stop-motion synchronisations
- hard cuts on main phase changes
- match cuts to help reading between very different work arrangements
- quick paced, general observed while benchmarking previously

### 5. Production

I didn't produce any storyboard regarding the work showcases, but completely let the music drive my design choices during the execution.

So, I used the listed works as a reference, and I moved forward building the reel.

I rendered the result at times to validate the reel part already done, as it is set in stone gradually.

## My current After Effects stack (2023)

As of today, I'm solely working from a laptop station and intent to stick with it as I'm still nomad.

Over time, I improved my workspace and share below what I value the most in terms of tools and plugins.

- [Flow](https://aescripts.com/flow/): to apply common easing presets
- [KBar](https://aescripts.com/kbar/): to pin shortcuts in a convenient icons sidebar
- [labels](https://aescripts.com/labels/): to apply pretty custom palette colors to timeline layers
- [void](https://www.battleaxe.co/void): to generate null/solid/variant without solid dependencies
- [overlord](https://www.battleaxe.co/overlord): to import Illustrator shapes as After Effects shapes
- [Ray Dynamic Color](https://aescripts.com/ray-dynamic-color/): to set color as global variables
- [Anchor points gravity](https://aescripts.com/anchor-point-gravity/): to change the anchor point setup

## Techniques I now use often

- Linear expressions: to drive multiple animations with mapped values on a single frame interpolation
- Prerenderings proxies: to speed up preview renders and final render for still comps requiering heavy calculations

## Result

And here is the [2023 Pommeclic showreel](https://vimeo.com/846247641).
