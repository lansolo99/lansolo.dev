## Context

Those last month, we experience a slow-down phase regarding work volume with PommeClic.

This gave us the time to think about updating the legacy agency website, untouched since 2020.

At first, I started to brainstorm + wireframed some section using Figma.

Quickly thought, the idea on releasing a showreel made its way as our video production got noticeable bigger over time.

This is what I call thinking showreel first ðŸ˜¼.

## Process

### Web design

After having setting up a pretty elegant homepage layout, I coded the design with Next.js + Framer Motion for the animations.

### Work selection

Then, we listed various works released during the last 18 months, trying to get a wide range of type.

### Storyboard

A showreel is built using existing pieces of works, so the process is different than designing a whole concept from scratch.

The focus here is dealing with rythm, transitions and some showcase principles.

The only whole creative part here was the intro. I storyboarded it using the desktop Storyboarder app and introduce the first work placeholder using some usual pages placeholder.

### Music first

I quickly realized it would be much more interesting to use the background music as a whole animation driver instead of just adding it on top at the end.

We decided ourself for an original chill/hip-hop piece, with a high emphase on timed beats.

This sound driver helped me define several key principles I would be using across the reel:

- stop-motion synchronisations
- hard cuts on main phase changes
- match cuts to help reading between very different work arrangements
- quick paced, general observed while benchmarking previously

### Producing

I didn't produce any storyboard regarding the work showcases, but completely let the music drive my design choices during the execution.

So, I used the listed works as a reference, and I moved forward building the reel.

I rendered the result at times to validate the work already done, as it is set in stone gradually.
