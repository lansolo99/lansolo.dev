## Context

Since I started adopting jamstack development, I've been experimenting multiple headless CMS solutions.

The one I liked the most so far is Strapi, a french initiative üá´üá∑üëç. It's open source, and in a very active development state. I already wrote [a post about it](/strapi-headless-cms-quick-review) in the past.

In the headless world, I think there's a very few solutions offering this model. The Strapi adoption is also excellent since it has ranked n¬∞1 according to [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/headless-cms/), so we can be sure it's a good bet for upcomming years.

This status means it's platform independent, and you boot your project locally, as someone could process using Wordpress.

## Strapi V4

The latest [Strapi V4](https://strapi.io/v4) version has been recently released, which brings a handful of improvements. I will give you my first impressions after having playing with it for a couple of days/weeks.

## Strapi conf

First, the [Strapi conf](https://conf.strapi.io/) has taken place for the first time a couple of days ago. You can find [their blog post](https://strapi.io/blog/strapiconf-2022-announcements-recap) that offers a quick recap among other topics. All the talks are made available so that you can catch-up on a lot of topics and demo features.
