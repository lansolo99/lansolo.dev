## Engaging in a "100 days"

I noticed over time these kind of "100 days" challenges, that some people decide to engage in publicly.

I always found it was a fun way to improve one-self in a targeted domain by producing recurring small pieces of work, that can be quantified.

As motion design demands have been a recurring thing over the last year, I decided to take back my 3D skill and bring it back into a motion design pipeline that could be part of my pro work.

## Own style

I tried to develop a personal 3D style over the time I worked for Gandi.net, massively using low poly meshes and cel shading renders. 

This kind of render is still my thing, but I would like to detach a bit of this usual trend by bringing more post effects and a more artistic touch.

This is what I started to work on, with the first iterations (4 as today).

You can see them on my [Dribbble channel](https://dribbble.com/lansolo19), where I have chosen to expose all my shots.

## Learning directions

I decided to focus working on my 3D style using Cinema 4D, along with its powerful Mograph module that offers endless possibilities. 

Among this: procedural animations, dynamics, and riggings.

Beside 3D, the complementary part is working on an effective workflow with After Effects. 

I intend to be comfortable rendering out motion graphics taking out the most of some 3D, binded with flat animations.

## Rythm

This post is named "100 days" but it won't be 100 days straight. 

It takes me a couples of day to produce a single loop as I don't want to rush out.

Every shot is the opportunity to dive into a specific tech or module.

Until now, I decided to stick to ecological transition thematics, as I feel pretty concerned.

Let's see what will come out of this, when I will reach the 100th shot üßëüèª‚Äçüíª‚ùì
