## 100 days of Mograph, follow up

Here is quick roundup of the latest shots I posted on Dribbble, after the anoucement of my [100 day of mograph](/posts/100-days-of-mograph) post.

At this time, I posted a dozen of shots:

### [Municipal waste evolution](https://dribbble.com/shots/21273942-Municipal-waste-evolution-per-person?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Municipal%20waste%20evolution%20per%20person&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Municipal%20waste%20evolution%20per%20person&utm_medium=Social_Share)

A bin is entirely swallowed by a trash truck. I relied on the constraint tag and some of C4D Xpresso configuration to link those 2 elements.

### [Transport modes stats for short distances](https://dribbble.com/shots/21351025-Transport-modes-stats-for-short-distances?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Transport%20modes%20stats%20for%20short%20distances&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Transport%20modes%20stats%20for%20short%20distances&utm_medium=Social_Share)

This is my first comeback to character animation. I always found rigging annoying and time-consuming. So I relied on [Mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/) pre-built animations to bypass this step. The process is pretty effective.

I have to say I didn't model the char, but tweaked an existing one, considering advanced modeling is not my thing.

### [Remote work evolution](https://dribbble.com/shots/21414689-Remote-work-evolution-in-France?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Remote%20work%20evolution%20in%20France&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Remote%20work%20evolution%20in%20France&utm_medium=Social_Share)

I pushed Mixamo a bit further this time with 2 characters in combination with circular maskings.

### [Dark mode journey](https://dribbble.com/shots/21513543-Dark-mode-journey?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Dark%20mode%20journey&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Dark%20mode%20journey&utm_medium=Social_Share)

I experimented an outlined-only style, still using Mixamo. I found this visual approach pretty interesting.

### [Reduce motion journey](https://dribbble.com/shots/21612680-Reduce-motion-journey?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Reduce%20motion%20journey&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Reduce%20motion%20journey&utm_medium=Social_Share)

I took the girl back from the previous shot and experimented mixing 2 Mixamo's animation. This illustrates a current web accessibility concern.

### [Dark mode city light switcher](https://dribbble.com/shots/21740758-Dark-mode-city-light-switcher?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Dark%20mode%20city%20light%20switcher&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Dark%20mode%20city%20light%20switcher&utm_medium=Social_Share)

Too much refactoring time invested on this scene regarding a disappointing result. I like the backdrop but missed the animation part.

### [Recycling game](https://dribbble.com/shots/21802654-Recycling-game?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Recycling%20game&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=lansolo19&utm_content=Recycling%20game&utm_medium=Social_Share)

I decided to keep the outline style but kept attention to rendering clean lines. This time using web UI supports trash bins elements. I like the animation but missed the UI design this time üôÅ.

## What's next?

I plan to keep improving on this low poly outlined style, mixing colors and darkmode, sometimes bringing characters.

Each loop takes me a couple of working days. It's the perfect opportunity to sharpen a very specific skill combination while developing a personal style.

I'm still very far to reach 100 shots, but as one say, _it's a journey, not a destination_ ü§ó.
