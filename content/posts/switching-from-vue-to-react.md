## Context

I have been using Vue for the last 2 years, and especially Nuxt and Gridsome to deliver static sites. I'm still enjoying the whole ecosystem and how the community is involved in its development (Vue 3, Vite, composition API, new Nuxt APIs...). 

As a solo freelance developer, I have the privilege to choose my stack. But I recently found myself in a situation where I was maybe looking to join a company. The thing is Vue, despite its wonderful API, remains way below its competitors in terms of global usage and demand in the job market. Angular is still widely used, though the community generally don't recommand start to learning it. However React is still the king and still will be for the upcomming years in my opinion.

So far, I always stayed away from it; because I didn't get the point in learning another tool to build the same kind of things and prefered to focus on mastering vue. But at the end, I thought it wouldn't hurt me to give it a try, both for employability, but also for my personal knowledge and to forge a true opinion on comparing both tools.
