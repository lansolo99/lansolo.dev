This post is a first of serie I intend to write on setting up Firebase with Nuxt. The aim of this serie is to act as a learning journal, and eventually help others on specific topics.

## The project

I recently started working on a proof of concept web-app that basically acts as a Linkedin website, but applied to a certain niche (I will communicate on this when the project will officially release). Users can register, login, fill their details, and get immediatly referenced on a profiles wall. Users can search for other registered profiles. I will add numerous features beside that but the scope of the serie is limited to setting up this core system.
