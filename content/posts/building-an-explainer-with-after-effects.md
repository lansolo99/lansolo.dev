## Back again to motion design!

It's already been a year I wrote a post on my first [After Effects skills serious upgrade](/posts/leveling-up-the-after-effects-game). 

Motion design business demands went into a spike at that time, so I decided to invest some motion design quality learning, beside my focus on front-end development.

It has been rewarding, both mentally and financially üòº.

The beginning of 2023 has been the opportunity to realize an explainer video for Banque Populaire, related to the group ecological transition and efforts.

## Explainer definition

What differentiates an explainer from other production? 

Well, it's adding a voice-over that mostly support what shows up on the screen, instead of texts, and educate people on a topic.

A voice-over needs a bit of planning, because its rythm drives the pace of the video and how elements appear.

## Process

I have been given a transcript.

As always, I realized a static storyboard for client's approval.

### Generated voice-over

At first, I used this transcript to create an auto-generated voice-over using [voicebooking.com](https://voicebooking.com). 

This service can handle any texts with multiples possible international voices.

I therefore, generated all the needed sentences, and it served me as a support to animate my elements and transitions.

I thought it would be ok, but the client found the result too "robotic" and wanted a real voice, only a few day before the due date üëè.

### Real voice-over

We should have hire a pro doing this, but decided to rely on a friend considering the deadline.

I handed-off the final video with subtitles, that adds up to the voice, so that is eased the recording process. 

To do so, I used [veed.io](https://www.veed.io), which generates subtitles based on a video soundtrack, same as a Youtube algorythm, except you can handle all the display and timing details with high precision.

This friend just passed me by its recording in a single file I just had to drop on the After Effects timeline. Thanks to him!

The result was ok, thought a bit unprofessional in some details (echos, weak voice tone...) but it did the job for the time we had left.

## Things I learned

As with every project, I integrated some principles in my workflow, grabbed from different courses that helped me produced a professional look&feel. 

Here are some key points :

- Master the rythm and flow to serve the content and keep user engaged : through intention of move, and the 12 Disney principles...
- Be consistent : identify several key effects & stick to the same style throughout the project
- Isolate main parts in pre-comps to ease later editing
- Set sound(s) as animations driver
- Keep things simple, add complexity once the main animation is covered
- Always render half-resolution, using the PRORES 422 preset to handle output file size
- Use and memorize keyboard shortcuts whenever its possible, for all recurrent actions, especially on timeline

## Result

Here is the [result](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/800250266) (french voice-over & subs).

I mostly use some animated icon libraries, considering the limited time I had (10 days).

I think I could have been a lot better if I used some complementary background colors, as well as more transition variations.

I restrict a bit too much regarding consistency, plus, the voice tend to give a "boring" flow.

## Wrapping-up

At least, I keep those "mistakes" back in my head, so that I can avoid them for the next motion I'm already working on üß®

It makes me happy to make progress also as a motion designer, considering video animation is a huge part of the web. 

It's not about targeting high-level artpieces, but mastering and delivering common client needs at best!
