This post is a round up of what I experimented this year at work.

## January
- The beginning of the year started with a lot of Framer-Motion digging with this small [drag-and-drop game](https://lansolo.dev/posts/drag-and-drop-puzzle-game-with-framer-motion/) we published
- I contribued on a open souce project for the first time (and also the last time this year) on [api.gouv.fr](https://api.gouv.fr/)
- I built a graphic designer portfolio for a friend using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Strapi](https://strapi.io/), but the project has never been launched publicly...

## February
- Play with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) automation with Google Spread sheet for a banking survey, one again, project never launched
- I realized a small motion using morphing shapes for [Colibri](https://vimeo.com/manage/videos/672775547), an internal banking project

## March
- I also was asking for animated UI prototypes and played a lot with [Framer](https://www.framer.com/) (not [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/docs/)), but never use it at the end ðŸ«¤
- Another [motion realized](https://vimeo.com/781027154), and I leveraged my skill when I discovered After Effect essential Graphics, a way to "componentize" compositions

## April
- I dove once again in [Maizzle](https://maizzle.com/), the Tailwind Css email framework, to implement banking email designs for Credit Agricole
- I Studied [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) a couple of days, for an upcoming design system project, that I finally never had to deal with

## May
- Inspired by Josh Comeau, I forked and published [my first npm package](https://lansolo.dev/posts/publishing%20a%20first%20node%20package%20on%20npm/)

## June
- Made a lot of UX/UI layouts for [Comiteo](https://www.comiteo.net/) an internal back office tool, using Sketch, work has never been published

## July
- I was forced to produce a huge specifications document using a summary and styled section, first serious office software skill improvment with [Pages](https://www.apple.com/fr/pages/)

## August
- Finally a real business opportunity to lean [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), producing a complete design system for [Bimpli](https://www.bimpli.com/) (B2B banking). It has now become my design tool of choice taking over Sketch

## September
- Took part in designing an internal webapp for "l'Ã‰toile". I was in charge of handing off the assets to Angular developers. I also realized a [small motion](https://vimeo.com/780886385)

## October
- I learned and immediatly used [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) to develop a small game (release plan for early 2023) and of course a whole dedicated post. Some caveats but mostly fell in love with this one, though, I still like Next.js
- Designed and developed a marketing package (motion + landing) for [Halloween 2022](https://lansolo.dev/posts/halloween-2022)

## November
- I had to update a legacy Nuxt project I built 2 years ago for a [banking card simulator](https://simulateur-carte.netlify.app/init/range). Nuxt has caveats but working with it once again was better that I expected

## December
- I worked on a lot of motion and emails design but nothing really new
- I'm finalizing the Svelte game, and I struggle with the reactive props and some bugs, some mechanism I have to understand deeper
- I started to play with [Next.js v13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13) and for another landing page. @next/font and quicker runtime ðŸš€

## Upcoming
- Probably more Svelte.js + Next projects
- Probably more motion designs
