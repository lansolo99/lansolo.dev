Following [the past 2022](/posts/2022-a-year-in-review) post, here is the new post rounding up of what I experimented this year at work.

## January

- I started with a new motion design for Banque Populaire, an explainer on their carbon footprint (and supposed improvments ðŸ¤­)

## February

## March

- I engaged into producing 3D animated shots intend to be exposed on [my Dribbble account](https://dribbble.com/lansolo19) on a regular basis.

## April

## May

## June

## July

- I realeased an [animated showreel for Pommeclic](https://vimeo.com/846247641), exposing our key work of those last 2 years.

## August

- On the personal side, I settled in Montpellier after 2 years as a nomadic.

## September

- I designed and developed a whole new agency website for [Pommeclic](https://www.pommeclic.com/).

## October

- I worked on a revamped version of the "spot the difference" mini-game for Banque Populaire. I did both artwork and [development](https://web-prod.bpce-bpri-prod-web2.nfrance.net/jeu-7-erreurs-2023-11/).

## November

- I worked on the design of a whole new variant version of the last year ["Blackout" game](/posts/first-sveltkit-project-with-blackout), called "Fin de chantier".

## December

- I delved into the development part of "Fin de chantier". I decided to migrate the whole codebase from Svelte to Next, and heavily introduced Github Copilot in my workflow.

## Upcoming/Wanting

- Some more Next.js projects
- Get involved in a dev team, open to position change ðŸ« 
- Still maintaining my design skills in some ways
