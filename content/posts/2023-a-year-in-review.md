Following [the past 2022](/posts/2022-a-year-in-review) post, here is the new post rounding up of what I experimented this year at work.

## January

- I started with a new motion design for Banque Populaire, [an explainer](https://vimeo.com/800250266) on their carbon footprint (and supposed improvments ðŸ¤­).

## February

- Released a very [short looping motion](https://vimeo.com/899002880) for Banque Populaire to be displayed in a stadium (ultra wide screens at ground level).

## March

- I engaged into producing 3D animated shots intend to be exposed on [my Dribbble account](https://dribbble.com/lansolo19) on a regular basis.

## April

- Banque Populaire ordered me multiple [animated shots](https://vimeo.com/899003063) showcasing supported Athletes for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

## May

- I coded the [Alliance Farine](https://alliance-farine.fr/) showcase website using Next + Wordpress as a headless CMS.

## June

- I mostly worked on personal [Dribble shots](https://dribbble.com/lansolo19).

## July

- I realeased an [animated showreel for Pommeclic](https://vimeo.com/846247641), exposing our key work of those last 2 years.

## August

- On the personal side, I settled in Montpellier after 2 years as a nomadic.

## September

- I designed and developed a whole new agency website for [Pommeclic](https://www.pommeclic.com/).
- I designed / animated / developed an animated game prototype leveraging the Tinder swipe gesture. I decided to make it [open-source on dev.to](https://dev.to/lansolo99/a-tinder-like-card-game-with-framer-motion-35i5) after the client gave up with idea.

## October

- I worked on a revamped version of the "spot the difference" mini-game for Banque Populaire. I did both artwork and [development](https://web-prod.bpce-bpri-prod-web2.nfrance.net/jeu-7-erreurs-2023-11/).

- Once again, the well advertised Hacktoberfest drove me in to open-source contribution. I participated on the small [file-api](https://github.com/Xkonti/file-api) project, with 2 validated PRs. This was the opportunity to experiment a bit with Docker and Bun runtime.

## November

- I worked on the design of a whole new variant version of the last year ["Blackout" game](/posts/first-sveltkit-project-with-blackout), called "Fin de chantier".

## December

- I delved into the development part of [Fin de chantier](https://jeu-pommeclic-fin-de-chantier.vercel.app/). I decided to migrate the whole codebase from Svelte to Next, and heavily introduced Github Copilot in my workflow.

- Another small motion for the [Berrylaw's greeting card](https://vimeo.com/898861313) (law firm).

## Upcoming/Wanting

- Some more Next.js projects
- Get involved in a dev team, open to position change ðŸ« 
- Still maintaining my design skills in some ways
