## Context

lately, I had the opportunity to develop a small showcase site, actually a visual update of a legacy site in the flour industry: . This was a classic Wordpress site as you can see below with an outdated design.

<!-- TODO: Insert legacy screenshot here -->

## Stack choice

The new design has already been made by a friend of mine, and I just had to care about web development.

The client wanted to continue using Wordpress for content management. Though, I wanted to use the modern JS stack I'm confortable with. Obviously, I decided to combine both desires and use Wordpress as headless CMS to generate content on a Next.js based front-end.

## Experience

## Deployment

Here is the new deployed site: [alliance-farine.fr](https://alliance-farine.fr)
