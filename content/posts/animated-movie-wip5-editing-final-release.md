The last shot has finally been finished 2 weeks ago, so we're about to release the movie a bit sooner than expected. This post will be the final report before the official release (see previous reports : wip#1, wip#2, wip#3, wip#4).

* I mostly worked on an alien planet environment, took the inspiration pretty much everywhere, a lot of inspiring stuffs on artstation
* I got hands on the hair module for the first time as I needed those for an alien entity designed by my team mate. This is easier to setup than expected, however, very ressource-heavy for all render calculations. Moving in the viewport becomes a nightmare
* Regarding this last one, I had to deal with one of the most pain in the ass thing in Cinema 4D : combining walking cycle with pose-morph tag expressions. These Cinema 4D systems give no room for error. So I ended up quite a few times with completely destroyed moving character because I forgot to register a key or switching in animated mode
* The sound-design part goes pretty well. Same goes for the editing phase : just a bunch of filters to setup on After Effects, taking advantage of [Looks](https://www.redgiant.com/products/magic-bullet-looks/) and [Damage](https://www.toolfarm.com/tutorial/digieffects_destabilize_from_damage_digieffects/), two amazing plugins.

The film is 4mn length. So we plan the release for the end of October.
