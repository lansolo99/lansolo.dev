## Context

Before I decided to take my front-end journey to the next-level, I felt reticent to dive into JS frameworks for a long time.
It appeared as an overwhelming engagement into learning if someone is not 100% into it, and it is in some way.

Nowadays, I guess almost all the front-end community embraced working with JS frameworks to sustain and ease all the cumbursome work we need to deliver modern web applications.

Learning those tools is a both enjoyable and exhausting thing, as it brings an insane amount of abstractions to memorize and practice.

## Vue

I started with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) in early 2019. I worked as a solo developer and I chose something with an easy learning curve.

I enjoyed it a lot and quickly jumped on [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), as I needed to render static pages.

I quickly tested [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) as I was into Cordova at this time, but it didn't suit my needs at the end.

Then I tried and adopted [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) for more than a year, as it perfectly suited my needs for simple static web pages. But I often found myself struggling with the GraphQL layer and lack of working third party tools.

## React

Two years has passed, and I considered finding a job in a company. I realized [React](https://reactjs.org/) was still the king on the job market, so I decided to learn it to be more employable. Same as Vue, I switched almost immediately on [Next](https://nextjs.org/) as static sites and landing pages were still on the table.

I totally embraced Next and it's powerful capacities regarding ISR and other very advanced deployment patterns. I loved the community and energy around it and I still love it.

## Svelte

I heard from [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) from a while and didn't consider learning a new tech until I finally got convinced about the simplified developer experience it brings, in comparison of all the over-engeneered and weird abstractions brought by React (yes, useEffect and all the stuff ^^).

I'm still on the phase of building a first solid project to hone my skills on it. It's to early to take a stock at the time, but my first impression is I really feel like writing component as an easier experience with its lightened syntax.

The result is the same but the flow is more enjoyable so far.

## Future?

As I'm actively following front-end dev, I'm aware of all the shiny toys that span here and there on a regular basis (Remix, Solid, Fresh, Deno, Eleventy, Qwik, Astro...), hard to position one-self into those.

As my experience grows, it feels easier and easier to jump from one tool to another, but there's still a lot of frictions at the beginning, the time to get used to the nitty-gritty of each solution.

I don't aim to experience every tool as some does. At the end, I'm just attracted by the promises on finding the best technical solution to deliver products in an enjoyable way.

I think there will always new paradigm that will get me to switch from a tool to another as time goes by.

I just think this switching pace is a bit too fast as I never felt mastering something enough so far.

Let's see how Svelte will maybe pave the way of this front-end journey for the upcoming times...
