This post is not focused on another tool I just discovered, but take stock of the self taught cycle I experiment in the tech industry.

## Context

I realized the other day I didn't feel connexions anymore with the Vue.js Ecosystem since I started using Next.js at the beginning of the year.

Though, I felt really involved and read anything I could about Vue that could keep me up to date for more than 2 years!

Now, the same thing is happening with Next.js: I subscribe to any content/event I can to build as much knowledge as possible on it...until I found something more relevant, who knows?

## Starting over and over...

When I decide to switch to another tech, it comes with a lot of dedicated time to build a valuable experience, and I often tell myself it's the definitive one to justify the effort.

I would say it's worth the time spent if we can leverage this knowledge for at least a couple of solid projects and preferably several years.

Ideally, I feel good when I start architecturing and building stuff in a flow state, without being stuck on every decision.

This is slowly happening with Next.js, even if the pace of release keep challenging me a bit too often, but that is also what is exciting at the end üòç.

## The stack I'm confortable with:

As it is stated on the featured image, here are a quick list of the tools I use on a day-to-day basis:

### Design

_Because I'm also often asked to make the design:_

- **Sketch**: Still the MacOS reference to me, despite having used Figma a little.
- **Illustrator**: Essential to edit vectors and create in a proper visual way.
- **After Effects**: Indispensable for every serious motion design work.
- **Photoshop**: It tend to dislike it more and more but is still relevant for every pixel editing work.

### Frontend

_What I try to specialize in:_

- **Next.js**: My beloved tool, ultra versatile, on the edge, with a justified exploding popularity.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Still happier than ever with the utility class approach it offers.
- **React Hook Form**: I switched from Formik to this one, very concise and more performant.
- **Framer Motion**: Endless animation possibilites and React dedicated.
- **Cypress**: Very user-friendly doc + gratifying test playground.

### Backend

_Because we also need to work with data and micro-services:_

- **Node.js**: Essentially used in the Next.js api route context as serveless + it's JS.
- **Strapi**: I found something free and flexible with this headless CMS, very simple API.
- **Firebase**: The easiest way to work with user authentication and client-side writings.

### Devops

_Because we need to deploy our app somewhere:_

- **Vercel**: The newcomer in my stack regarding static hosting, work hand-to-hand with Next.js.
- **Netlify**: I still really like it, but it's less suitable to work with Next.js.
- **Heroku**: THe easiest way to deploy a Node.js app.

## And a lot more...

I didn't mentioned others, such as:

- Cloudinary as a complete solution for hosting medias
- Send In Blue, which is my digital marketing platform to handle email routing
- Maizzle, to build email templates
- Cinema 4D, to build 3D graphics & animations (so much time spent on it!)
- Other valuables CMS such as Prismic and Storyblock which I experimented once
- Wordpress, that I don't use anymore, but is still a thing
- Mamp Pro
- Typescript
- Docusaurus
- Snipcart
- Vscode + all plugins + all shortcuts
- All the MacOS helpers (Alfred, Flux, Dropbox)
- Evernote
- Spark
- Clickup
- Google Analytics / Google Tag Manager
- Protopie
- Algolia
- AWS.......

The infinite pool of tools, enough to make you nauseous ü§¢ü§Æ.

But that also what we like, being stuck in endless challenges! üòµ‚Äçüí´
